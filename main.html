                    <p>
                        My name is Karl Lukan and I'm majoring in IT Software Development at Mid-State Technical College.
                        I'm primarily into web development, but I also love anything related to programming.
                        With that in mind I can also consider myself a techie, ever since I was 12 I've been enamored about computers of all shapes and sizes.
                        <b>P.S I use Debian</b>

        <section class="content-section" id="projects">
            <h1 class="section-header">Projects</h1>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col text-left">
                    <a href="">
                        <h2 class="subheader">Resume</h2>

                    <p>
                        I built this during downtime during my 2nd semester.
                        Has a very sectional structure to it and uses a lot of CSS grid.
                        Mainly HTML/CSS with some JS.
                    </p>

                    <a href="">
                        <h2 class="subheader">Blogstrap</h2>
                    </a>
                    <p>
                        This was used so I could learn about the grid features in Bootstrap.
                        I intended it to be some sort of blog, but I soon realized I'm not the type for that.
                        I still use this page for reference if I need to use Bootstrap.

                    <p>
                        Built this in a couple weeks during my first semester.
                        As you can tell by the title, it was the final for my Web Design class.
                        Did pretty good on it too.

                    </a>
                    <p>
                        Built this along with an agile team in my Collaborative Application Development class.
                        It consists of HTML/CSS/JS and we used the Bootstrap CSS framework and the JQuery JS library.
                        The class primarily taught agile development skills while we did web development.
