### As you may know, this is my website.
#### Summary
My personal website, built with Blazor WebAssembly and hosted via Azure Static Web Apps. Also contains an administrative interface, but it's unused as I don't want to pay for hosting an API. For now, models are deserialized from a local JSON document and displayed on the page. The live site can be found [here](karllukan.com).
